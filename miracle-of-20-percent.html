                    <h2>The Miracle of the "Modest" 20 Percent</h2>
                    
                    <div class="excerpt">
                        <p>Historically (from 1965 to 2023), Berkshire Hathaway has achieved a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 19.8%. While this figure may seem modest compared to the "anomalies" of short-term trading gains, it is extraordinary for the following three reasons:</p>

                        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: var(--font-heading);">1. The Power of Long-Term Consistency</h3>
                        <p>Buffett's success is not defined by a single year of 1,000% returns, but by his ability to sustain ~20% for nearly 60 years. This illustrates the extreme power of compounding.</p>
                        <p>The mathematical difference between the market average (S&P 500 at ~10%) and Buffett (~20%) over a lifetime is not merely double; it is exponential.</p>
                        <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                            <li><strong>The Market (10%):</strong> If you invested roughly $1,000 over 50 years, it would grow to approximately $117,000.</li>
                            <li><strong>Buffett (20%):</strong> That same $1,000 would grow to approximately $9.1 million.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A simple 2x difference in annual performance results in an 80x difference in final wealth when sustained over decades.</p>

                        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: var(--font-heading);">2. The Difficulty of Outperforming the Index</h3>
                        <p>Very few investors can consistently beat the market index over a prolonged period.</p>
                        <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                            <li><strong>S&P 500 Performance:</strong> ~10.2% annually (including dividends).</li>
                            <li><strong>Berkshire Hathaway Performance:</strong> ~19.8% annually.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While a 9.6% margin seems small in any given year, the cumulative effect is staggering. Over the 1965–2023 period, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of roughly 31,000%, whereas Berkshire Hathaway delivered a total return exceeding 4,380,000%. This confirms your earlier sentiment: while outlier years happen, maintaining an "edge" over the market for half a century is the true miracle.</p>

                        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: var(--font-heading);">3. The Constraint of Scale (The Law of Large Numbers)</h3>
                        <p>It is significantly harder to grow a large portfolio than a small one. Buffett has frequently noted that if he were managing only $1 million, he could likely achieve 50% returns by investing in smaller, high-growth companies.</p>
                        <p>However, because he manages hundreds of billions of dollars, he is forced to invest in massive, mature companies where growth is naturally slower. To maintain a ~20% CAGR despite the "gravity" of such a massive capital base is arguably his most impressive feat.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 30px;">The 20% figure is not a sign of mediocrity; it is the statistical upper limit of sustainable, long-term financial scalability. It serves as a reminder that while "anomalies" make for exciting headlines, it is the "boring" consistency that builds dynasties.</p>
