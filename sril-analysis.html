                    <h2>The Rise and Fall of Sritex (SRIL): A Tale of Ignored Red Flags</h2>
                    
                    <div class="excerpt">
                        <p>Sri Rejeki Isman Tbk (SRIL), widely known as Sritex, was once the largest integrated textile manufacturer in Southeast Asia. Its golden era began in 1994 when it secured prestigious contracts to produce military uniforms for NATO and the German Army. The company’s resilience was legendary; it not only survived the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis but also managed to grow eightfold compared to its initial integration in 1992.</p>

                        <p>The company’s trajectory seemed unstoppable. In 2014, Iwan S. Lukminto was honored as Forbes Indonesia’s Businessman of the Year and EY Entrepreneur of the Year. Sritex also collected numerous accolades, including the IP Enterprise Trophy from WIPO and being named a Top Performing Listed Company in 2015. Until 2019, SRIL consistently reported rising net profits, maintained a seemingly reasonable valuation, and was a staple in the prestigious LQ45 index, signifying high liquidity and market trust.</p>

                        <p>When I began my career as a civil servant at the Audit Board of Indonesia (BPK RI) in early 2022, I noticed that our official uniforms were also produced by Sritex. The quality was undeniably excellent. However, I soon learned a harsh lesson in investing: superior product quality does not necessarily translate to sound financial management.</p>

                        <p>In my superficial analysis at the time, I overlooked two critical red flags: an alarmingly high debt-to-equity ratio and a continuous increase in accounts receivable. The facade began to crumble when the company failed to submit its Q1 2021 financial report, leading to its suspension by the Indonesia Stock Exchange on May 18, 2021. Fortunately, I look back at this as a valuable lesson learned at a very low cost, as my investment in SRIL was less than IDR 1 million. The rest is history.</p>
